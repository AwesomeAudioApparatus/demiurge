# Demiurge

## Introduction

The Demiurge is a Eurorack module which is meant for software development and experimentation.  It contains the following features:

* CPU is CH32V307, which is a 144MHz RISC-V, single core with FPU.
* 256 kB flash storage (divided between firmware and files)
* 64 kB of RAM
* 1 RGB LED which can be controlled by serial data
* 4 LEDs which can be controlled by PWM
* 4 Potentiometers 
* 4 Push buttons with debounce circuitry
* 1 digital input which can be used as Gate or Midi input
* 4 12 bit Analog inputs which can be sampled at up to 1 Msps in total
* 2 12 bit Analog outputs which can be switched between +/-10V or +/- 5V.
