# Readme
This software is organized to be a Demiurge Sound Processing project, from
which the STM32PackCreator (../stm32-packs/demiurge1) will read the files to
package up the installable Software Pack in STM32CubeMX.

**NOTE 1**: This is intended as the development environment for the Installable 
packs, not to derive your own projects from.

**NOTE 2**: Only the build system and IDE setup of Jetbrains' CLion IDE will
be actively maintained. Any STM32CubeIDE files may or may not work; maintainers
are welcome.
